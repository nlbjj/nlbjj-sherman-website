Our youth Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu program is designed for children ages 5-13, with two specialized age groups:

## Little Champs (Ages 5-9)
Focus on discipline, fun, movement patterns, and base control. Perfect for young children to develop coordination, confidence, and basic BJJ concepts through engaging games and activities.

## Junior Warriors (Ages 10-13)
Structured training focusing on drilling, technique precision, and situational sparring. This program serves as a bridge to adult classes for mature students.

We emphasize:

- **Character Development**: Building discipline, respect, and confidence
- **Physical Fitness**: Improving coordination, strength, and flexibility
- **Self-Defense Skills**: Age-appropriate techniques for personal safety
- **Social Skills**: Teamwork, friendship, and positive peer interaction
- **Fun Learning**: Engaging activities that make learning enjoyable

Our experienced instructors create a positive, encouraging environment where young students can thrive while learning valuable life skills through martial arts.
