                            <p class="lead">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has a rich and storied history that traces back to the Gracie family in Brazil. Understanding this lineage is essential to appreciating the art and the responsibility that comes with being part of this tradition.</p>

                            <h2>The Origins of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h2>
                            <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu began in the early 20th century when Mitsuyo Maeda, a Japanese judoka, traveled to Brazil and taught the art to Carlos Gracie. Carlos, along with his brothers, particularly Helio Gracie, adapted and refined the techniques to create what we now know as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>

                            <h3>The Gracie Family Legacy</h3>
                            <p>The Gracie family has been instrumental in developing and spreading Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu worldwide. Each generation has contributed to the evolution of the art while maintaining its core principles:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Carlos Gracie:</strong> The founder who first learned from Maeda and established the Gracie Academy</li>
                                <li><strong>Helio Gracie:</strong> Carlos's younger brother who refined the techniques for smaller practitioners</li>
                                <li><strong>Rorion Gracie:</strong> Helio's son who brought BJJ to the United States and created the UFC</li>
                                <li><strong>Rickson Gracie:</strong> Considered by many to be the greatest BJJ practitioner of all time</li>
                                <li><strong>Rilion Gracie:</strong> Our direct connection to the Gracie legacy</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Master Rilion Gracie: Our Direct Lineage</h3>
                            <p>Master Rilion Gracie is a direct descendant of the Gracie family and has dedicated his life to preserving and teaching authentic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

                            <h4>Master Rilion's Contributions</h4>
                            <p>Master Rilion has made significant contributions to the BJJ community:</p>
                            
                            <ol>

                            <h4>The Importance of Lineage</h4>
                            <p>In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, lineage is more than just a family tree – it's a direct connection to the source of knowledge and technique. This connection ensures:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Authentic instruction:</strong> Techniques taught exactly as they were developed</li>

                                <li><strong>Competition influence:</strong> How sport BJJ has influenced the art's development</li>
                                <li><strong>Self-defense focus:</strong> Maintaining the original purpose of practical self-defense</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Our Responsibility as Practitioners</h3>
                            <p>Being part of the Gracie lineage comes with certain responsibilities:</p>
