                            <p>Tony holds a 4-year dual university degree in Physical Education from Brazil, combining Sports Science and Teaching. 
                            This program is equivalent to a U.S. Bachelor's degree—but with full specialization from day one, without general education classes. 
                            His academic formation focused on human performance, biomechanics, motor learning, pedagogy, and youth development—which directly 
                            shapes the methodology and training philosophy at Next Level Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
